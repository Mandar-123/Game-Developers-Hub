# Game-Developers-Hub
- By the medium of this website, we attempt to provide a hub for game developers and graphic designers, which helps such users from different domains with a wider exposure as compared to the traditional company based approach to meet designers or developers from established companies, as compared to meeting new budding artists, since both have need for each other.

- The hub makes communication easier than ever, as both can check each otherâ€™s portfolio at real time, at any place, and know the experience and genuinity of the other, along with which they can chat and develop in real time, since data would be documented for easier reference.

- This Web Application uses 
  - HTML, CSS and Javasript as frontend languages.
  - PHP as backend language
  - It also uses Bootstrap and JQuery frameworks.
